Who knows you might end up becoming a Cricket Analyst!!

It's important to know the average number of balls that a batsman plays.
This goes a long way in deciding the batting order or analysing the type of cricket a batsman plays.
It will help us find whether a batsman is an aggressive player or likes building his innings.
