## Get the array of all delivery numbers when a given player got out

Nice work, on clearing the first hurdle.

Now let's dig dipper and analyze more about batsmen.
Who knows you might end up becoming a Cricket Analyst!!

It's important to know the average number of balls that a batsman plays.
This goes a long way in deciding the batting order or analysing the type of cricket a batsman plays.

It will help us find whether a batsman is an aggressive player or likes building his innings.

So, let's write a function to get the number of deliveries 
faced by a batsman before got out with following specifications.

**The function should**
- Be named `get_wicket_delivery_numbers_array`
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object. We have already imported that for you

## PARAMETERS
- Accept one mandatory parameter named `player` 
- `type : str`

## RETURNS
- Should return a numpy array of all (non unique) delivery numbers when a player got out.
- `type : numpy array`

Let's try becoming a **Cricket Analyst**.
