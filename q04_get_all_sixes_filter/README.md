# Create a filter that filters only those records where the batsmen scored 6 runs

Good Job!!

Modern Cricketers and spectators love Sixes. Well, who doesn't?

Batsmen in IPL usually compete amongst themselves to hit the maximum number of sixes. Bowlers suffer the most, poor souls!!

IPL teams usually crave for the batsmen who hit sixes the most.
During IPL auction, teams usually look out for such power hitters.


## Create a function `get_all_sixes_filter` that :
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object and extracts all the runs scored as sixes.

### PARAMETERS:
- No Parameters

### RETURNS:
| Parameter | dtype  | description |
| :---: | :---: |:---: |
| variable | numpy.array |  boolean array telling where the runs scored as sixes or not |

**Note that you have to return the filter array itself, not the records with sixes**

So, lets do it.
