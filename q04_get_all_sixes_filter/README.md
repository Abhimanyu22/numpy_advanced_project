## Create a filter that filters only those records where the batsmen scored 6 runs

Good Job!!

Sixer!! Sixer!! ...

Modern Cricketers and spectators love Sixes.

Well, who doesn't?

Batsmen in IPL usually compete amongst themselves to hit the maximum number of sixes.

Bowlers suffer the most, poor souls!!

IPL teams usually crave for the batsmen who hit sixes the most.
During IPL auction, teams usually look out for such power hitters.

**Note that you have to return the filter array itself, not the records with sixes**

Create a function that answers this question.

**The function should**
- Be named `get_all_sixes_filter`
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object

## PARAMETERS
- No Parameters

## RETURNS
- Return **the filter** you created
- `type : numpy.array`
- dtype of array: bool

So, lets do it.
