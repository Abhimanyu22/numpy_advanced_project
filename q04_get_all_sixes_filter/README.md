## Create a filter that filters only those records where the batsman scored 6 runs

Good Job!!

Sixer!! Sixer!! ...

Modern Cricketers and spectators love Sixes.

Well, who doesn't?

Batsmen in IPL usually compete amongst themselves to hit the maximum number of sixes.

Bowlers suffer the most, poor souls!!

IPL teams usually crave for the batsmen who hit sixes the most.
During IPL auction, teams usually look out for such power hitters.

Note that you have to return the filter array itself, not the records with sixes

Create a function that answers this question.

Write a function with to get the number of sixes 
scored by a batsman with following specifications.

**The function should**
- Be named `get_all_sixes_filter`
- Work on the previously created `ipl_matches_array` object

## PARAMETERS
- No Parameters

## RETURNS
- Return all those indexes in the given array, where there is atleast one six present i.e return an array of matches where atleast one six was hit
- `type : numpy.array`

So, lets do it.
